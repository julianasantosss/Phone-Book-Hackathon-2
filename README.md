# Phone-Book-Hackathon-2
This project is a simple phonebook management system that allows users to store, organize, and manage contacts. A contact is defined by a first name, last name, and phone number. The system supports adding, searching, updating, and deleting contacts with key validations to avoid duplicates and empty fields.

## Key Features
- **Add Contact:** Adds a contact if it doesn’t already exist and the phonebook isn’t full.
- **Duplicate Check:** Verifies if a contact with the same name and last name exists.
- **List Contacts:** Displays contacts in alphabetical order.
- **Search Contact:** Finds a contact by name and shows the phone number.
- **Delete Contact:** Removes a contact, with success or error messages.
- **Update Phone Number:** Modifies a contact’s phone number.
- **Full Check:** Indicates if the phonebook is full.
- **Free Space Info:** Shows available slots for new contacts.

## Agenda Configuration

- A custom maximum size.
- A default size of 10 contacts.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or later.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
